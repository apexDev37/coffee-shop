## Introduction
This project demonstrates a full-stack web application setup with _advanced_ authentication and authorization via API-based integrations with a scalable Identity Provider, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

### üê±‚Äçüíª Identity and Access Management concepts applied:
- **Foundation**: Set the groundwork for understanding information security fundamentals and posture.
- **Identity & Authentication**: Implement modern software patterns and explore methods for identifying who is making requests on web systems.
- **Passwords**: Overcome common pitfalls of the ubiquitous password authentication design pattern through advanced hashing, encryption, and mitigation strategies.
- **Access & Authorization**: Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) across the entire stack to limit access to specific resources or actions.
- **Thinking Adversarially**: Stay one step ahead of attackers by implementing a secure development process and knowing how to keep informed on the cutting edge of security research.
